### What is TangLike?
[**TangLike**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/TangLike) is a tools to make it easier for us to get likes on Facebook posts for free. This tools is equipped with a function to solve captcha codes so that we don't have to do it manually. One account only has 10 attempts per day to send likes, you can use another account if you want to send likes again.

You can get 100 to 50 likes in less than 5 minutes and you are also limited to every 15 minutes for sending the next like.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter this command into termux!

```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/TangLike
$ cd "TangLike"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/TangLike" && git pull
$ python Run.py
```

### Why aren't likes coming in?
- Maybe there was an error in the post ID you entered or the post is not in public mode.
- There are no users available in this service.
- The service is being repaired or is no longer working.

### Error bypassing CAPTCHA?
- We recommend using this tool from 9 am to 5 pm, so that the captcha bypassing service is active.
- Maybe your key is no longer valid or your credit has run out.
- The service for bypassing captchas is being repaired or is no longer working.

### Why login failed?
- Maybe your cookies have expired or your account has been checkpointed.
- You can use another account if you still can't log in.
- Your account has been detected as spam so Facebook won't allow you to log in.
